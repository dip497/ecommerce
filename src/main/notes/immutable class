- make class final - cant extend and overide method
- make variable final - cant change value
- no setter method - cannot set variables
- if have depened variable make it final and
    when using get method provide copy of that object
    while returning the new object using copy constructor concept
    for e.q return new Address(address);
    and in Address class
        Address( Address address){
            this(address.getName.....);
        }
    also best practice is that get a method static getInstance  method in address classs
    that accpt address and return new object
    so get method becomes
        public getAddress(Address address){
        return Address.getInstance(address);
        }

prons of immmutable class
    - thread safe
        one read , one write
    - constants
    - used as hashmap key
