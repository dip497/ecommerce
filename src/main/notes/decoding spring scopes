Spring bean scope
    singleton - single object
    @Scope(ConfigurableBeanFactory.SCOPE_PROTOTYPE)
    or
    @Scope(value="prototype")
    prototype - every time object
        - Bean initialisattion
            1 ) singleton scoped beans initialize when the container started
            2) prototype scoped beans initalize when we ask for it using getBean method and also when
            it is used as dependency inside a singleton scoped bean

        problem :-  when singleton has prototype dependence then that works
        as singleton
        for e.g school is singleton and student is prototye
        then school student object will be same

        so need to fool school class
        use proxyMode
        @Scope(value="prototye",proxyMode=ScopedProxyMode.TargetClass)

         it is done using spring cg Library
            Spring code Generation library
         can change class

         @autowired
         Private Student student
            now hold $$EnhancerBySpringCGLIB object
