how many types of containers are there in spring framework
    1) BeanFactory Container
    2) Application Context Container
what is spring Ioc container and how does it work
    - spring ioc is core of spring framework
    - ioc create the object configures and assembles their dependencies, manages their entire life cycle
    - the ioc containers use dependency injection manage the components that make up the application
    - ioc get the information about the objects from configuration file xml , java code or java annotations
    and java pojo class the objects are called beans
    - since the controlling of java objects and their lifecycle is not done by the developers
    hence the name inversion of control

BeanFactory and applicationContext interface hierachy
    -  org.springframework.beans.factory.BeanFactory
        and org.springframework.context.applicationContext interface acts as the ioc container
    - the applicationcontext interface is built on top of the beanFactory interface
difference between BeanFactory and ApplicationContext container
standalone , support singleton and prototye and does not support annotations near xml



















SpringBootApplication
    configuration

    EnableAutoConfiguration
        it enables spring boot to auto-configure the application context
            it automatically creates and registers beans based on both the included files
            in the classpath and the beans defined by user
    ComponentScan
        it detect and register Spring Managed Compenets
            (component,repository,controller,service,configuration,restController)
            with application arguments
            @componentScan without argument tells spring to scan the current package
            and all of it sub-packages
    (spring is opinion framework)
    Note :- Order is very important
        spring always first perform user configuration via @componentScan and then auto
        configuration via @EnableAutoConfiguration this order is crucial as spring need to know
        about all the beans that you have provided to make sure that it prioritize your opinion while
        autoconfiguration
            example :- if you have already provided dataSource bean, spring will back and not configure DataSource
                using autoconfiguration
